      <h2>The Moment that Changed my Life Expectations</h2>
      <p class='normText' style="text-indent: 2em">
        My name is Aleksei Nechaev and I am on a wheelchair.
        When my first year in the United States started,
        I was In high school where I had a language barrier and I was scared to make new friends. 
        On the first day I was at lunch and saw a student in a wheelchair at another table who had a disability.
        I was shocked at the moment because he had a lot of friends near him and  he was laughing with them. 
        Instead, in Russia people with disabilities don’t go outside 
        and can’t make friends with people who don’t have these conditions.
         It’s not that they don’t want to go out, 
         it's just impossible because there are no ramps and too many stairs. 
         This guy who I saw at lunch impressed me because I understood Russian realities. He gave me great hope and inspiration that I would make new friends in this new world once my language barrier became less.
          This is how my journey in learning English began.

      <p class='normText' style="text-indent: 2em">
        My first step was to meet new people who were learning the English language like me in my first class. This made me understand that I was not alone. Mrs. Hemphill's first activity was a hard task about how to introduce ourselves. When it was my turn to introduce myself I realised that I didn’t know how to speak at all. It was horrible for me and my face turned red. It was silent except for the pencil tapping on a student’s desk. After the horrible silence all I could say was, “hello.”

      <p class='normText' style="text-indent: 2em">
        During my senior year in high school, I was gradually improving my reading and writing skills. I moved up to my second level of ESL, so students had higher English abilities and their expectations were higher, teachers wanted more from us. I tried my best to learn in this class how to write essays and even how to write a narrative essay. One day Mrs. Pun, my level two ESL teacher, gave us an assignment that I didn’t expect because I had never written this type of essay. She said that we would go out to get inspiration, so it would help us to remember some situations in our lives. We went out, and I heard birds singing, and my mood changed immediately and my memory was flying in my head. I didn’t even know where to start. I was writing and then deleting sentence by sentence. When the teacher walked out to help another student I immediately heard in my head words “take from your soul and write.” I was directly thinking that I finally found what to write. I learned from Mrs. Pun that if you start to struggle with what to write, go outside and you will hear great ideas from your soul.

      <p class='normText' style="text-indent: 2em">
        Now I graduated from high school, and enrolled in college. I feel much better than in my first day of school, but the difference is that college expects more from you than high school. When I introduced myself in college orientation I felt more confidence in myself and could speak in front of people without fear. I am thinking how cool it will be for other people who come to school without knowing any English to meet a person like me who can give encouragement. Then people will learn other languages without as much fear as I had.  I will write a book about my experience in high school so other people will not feel as alone as I did. They will see other people have even harder situations.
